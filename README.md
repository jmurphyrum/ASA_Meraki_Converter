# ASA_Meraki_Converter

Here's an example script in Python that can help you convert a Cisco ASA configuration file to Meraki MX compatible rules. The script reads the ASA configuration file, extracts the necessary information, and generates the corresponding Meraki MX rules. Please note that this is a basic example, and you might need to customize it based on your specific requirements.

You need to provide the ASA configuration file path in the asa_config_file variable. The script reads the file, processes each line, and extracts relevant information such as object groups, network objects, service objects, and access-list entries. It then converts these entries into Meraki MX rules and stores them in the converted_rules list.

Please note that this script is a basic starting point and may require modification based on the complexity and specific features used in your ASA configuration. Additionally, it assumes that the ASA configuration follows standard syntax and conventions. Make sure to test and validate the converted rules before deploying them on your Meraki MX device.
